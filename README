Simple Entity Component Framework
======================================================================================
For use in games to get rid of the classic monolithic hierarchy.

Basically an Entity (game object) is now just a bag of components.
A Component is just an object with a reference back to the entity which owns it.

The EntityManager creates Entities and manages access to groups of Components based on type.
This makes it easy to only iterate over only the objects that need to be iterated over.

Example:
when rendering, you only want the objects that have renderable components.
